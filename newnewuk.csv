0,He’s probably a Trump supporter so probably would tolerate an American cup of tea
0,or perhaps from the UVF and their mobs who really did burn out the residents of Belfast
0,Me too I’m an NHS Dr I’d like him to tell me he doesn’t want to see me
0,Well as in my view he is threatening to burn your house down I would call the police There is nothing reasonable about this person nothing you can talk to and you need to protect yourself
0,I would just say thank you and goodbye As for reprisals from the likes of him I don’t think so Let’s hope he doesn’t come across one of “our lot” when he needs NHS care I presume he would turn it down Good for him

0,Response ignore the trolls and racists it only gives their minority views publicity
0,Well done inviting these people to have a cup of tea is the only sensible thing to do
0,Is this from the Ipswich and Suffolk councillor

0,Willing to bet good money theres NO way in hell to do blanket content based exclusion deeming a site problematic based on dynamic content and are the only people who can code an alert mechanism for problematic content Harrys SM answered not their DM teams
0,We should actually call that they have a fake hate filled website on their adsense network
0,Luckily its not that complicated
0,They already responded So you should probably stop worrying about it now
0,Daily monitoring across s of URLs It took Hewlett Packard a social monitoring department of  housed in the space the size of an air traffic control room with high performance server clusters just to monitor their social pages Youre expecting too much from Harrys
0,Thats probably a question youd be best placed asking them But as a general rule this is a due diligence process similar in character to that carried out by brands in relation to other types of supplier
0,How does a biz like Harrys decide who goes on that excl list By individually reading the content on each AdSense Partner website 
0,Or is just the advertising a problem PC regardless Id rather be told upfront and save time interviewing needlessly Have you read Job Descriptions where specific traits or dearth of languagequalifications exclude equal opportunity employment
0,Its much easier than that Most brands already have an exclusion list in place so its just about adding one more problematic site to that list
0,So Harrys is to now check content daily across thousands of AdSense websites with no real time stats from Google on where their ads are featured If you had any idea of PPM ad networks youd actually be telling GOOGLE to exclude OpI pl advise re Halal

0,RT Sorry you are not in the Shadow Cabinet but I am sure under the new leadership you will get a lot more support
0,RT Let rip
0,RT Go for them Jess The government is not only BJ there are enough of them around to do something about this
0,RT Totally agree Jess  pictures of people dying on the streets would’ve caused uproar but what you can’t see
0,RT No strategy for charities either
0,RT It wouldnt even been on their radar Jess All they are looking at is minimum cost and penny pinching because they completely ignored the threat for months They gambled with our lives and lost
0,😄😄 you win the prize for the quickest time its taken a man to accuse a woman of man hating one tweet Congrats love
0,Thanks for someones opinion piece on the topic of men Ive been abused I know people who have spent an entire lifetime trying to get over it because society shuns them from opening up about it No I wont shut up Abuse is abuse Its not gender specific
0,Your experience is your experience but I cant see any domestic abuse specialists supporting this approach at all
0,One rule for some
0,Nothing will work Until the person being abused decides to do something Getting to that pointif they do can take many failed attempts Other peoples opinion is of no relevance its only when they are ready Sometimes its not a one way thing both can be as bad as the other
0,oh hello Jess youre back nice to see you  so youre all set to restart the gurning outpourings cant wait 
0,Surely there are local hotels hostels that aren’t being used or new or empty houses or people with spare rooms
0,She’s so on point this women every time she seems to get it right
0,I have and I throughly enjoy them He and Gary Neville have been shinning lights during this current crisis And Jordan Henderson for rallying all the club captains together I’d be ashamed if I’d had a sex party during lockdown but I haven’t so I’m not ashamed
0,I think it is more about saving money amp resources as Covid would be otherwise rampant in a street homeless population However this then raises the question of what physicalpsychological injuries amp deaths would be similarly considered as too costly of money amp resources
0,Go on then whats the answer
0,Thick as S xxxx These working class boys cant even give their salaries despite being multi millionaires Then when they get cv theyll want an nhs nurse on £k to look after them 
0,you are correct amigo
0,Im done being nice A bad turn of phase when talking about domestic violence
0,RT Yessssss  The petition has reached k signatures in a week this needs to be looked at to help those victims of abuse who need help more than ever during lockdown can you push it
0,Go on then lets here it Genius
0,Some may say he stopped playing about  years ago
0,RT Appallingly exploitative behaviour by KyleWalker here Horrific example to boys Prostituted women are always at risk in a pandemic even more so I hope the whole English football scene  unanimously condemn this
0,
0,What’s your suggested strategy Jessy
0,journalists are supposed to be impartial and investigate she does neither
0,RT getting it bang on
0,Do you know Covid Mutual Aid on FB Jess They have groups all over
0,Can’t see the reply she gave in how she would deal with it or is it just another question she can’t answer
0,Yes This absolutely has to be addressed properly Lets remember the vast number of vulnerable children that will also be trapped in abusive families They have even less freedom and its almost certainly easier to hide their abuse under lockdown
0,RT Thanks to all kindly offering space but space is not the issue it is the willingness of government to agree to fund that space at massively reduced rates that dont even cover costs really and to fund the support that goes in it
0,You cant help them unless they want the help THEY have to feel that leaving is the right thing to do when i was with a violent partner so many people begged me to leave him but only when i had exhausted all options of thinking i could change him did i leave him
0,getting it bang on
0,
0,See point  above 🖕🏼
0,Set out your strategy Jess Just pretend you’re in Government never happen but visualise it How do you reduce Domestic violence in a lockdown situation Give us your top  actions
0,Solutions please
0,I don’t understand why we are trying to find a way for women to escape  why are the police not taking the violent men away and slinging them in nick for the duration
0,Maybe its the morons who knock their partners about who need to develop their own straregy NOT the PMs job
0,RT Thank you xxxx
0,I’m an ordinary long standing member of the Lab Pty whose has never experienced an episode of antisemitism can someone direct me to an authoritative incontrovertible source evidencing this form of alleged prejudice so I can assess for myself Prejudice is irrational amp wrong
0,Honestly youd think you have all the answers Aren’t MP’s supposed to find solutions You have that job for a reason Find a solution All you appear to find is problems
0,
0,According to the fucking guardian
0,What can the community do
0,Good Nice doesnt work with this lot
0,You won’t get an answer to that
0,RT  please can you do me a massive favour and retweet this Anything you can do to help would be appreciated This is for a wonderful woman who helps get sick animals animals off the streets and into their forever home fit healthy and happy
0,Its not an honour Its a list of shame of mendacity of duplicity of deceit of manipulation of egregious use of the sacred memory of dead Jews for poisonous political ends You have literally nothing to be proud of And your answer to the question Ill keep waiting
0,JHB’s job is not to be nice  like all journalists her job is to question and to do that sometimes means coming at the subject from a different viewpoint
0,Glad you got out safely in the end
0,Hold perpetrator to account Provide secure amp long term housing for victim Fund specialist services properly All police trained Ensure children are supported Have support available via health employers social services Better online support Public awareness campaign
0,Julia she has probably realised it was a really daft tweet and she is ignoring answering you
0,
0,Shame you were not done being nice amp constructive when all the little white girls were getting raped by religiously motivated paedophiles jess I dont remember you jumping to back Sarah Champion or challenging Naz Shah after her infamous tweet like Domestic violence is wrong
0,
0,RT domestic abuse is such a hard topic Jess I was a victim myself  abused people are often unable for various reasons to see a way out we could do more in schools so that children can safely report when they believe it is happening at home  fear stops us from reaching out
0,Has Jess answered yet
0,I’d say ‘acted quickly’ was slightly incorrect but agree that we need a strategy to support vulnerable adults and children
0,Bollox
0,Its really the hardest problem The only solution is enforced separation and support Its a sad state of affairs that people dont have family or friends to help State intervention should be the last resort
0,We could go and knock on doors where we think there is abuse and ask not serious
0,The solution is a simple one Lock up the abusers Problem solved
0,Who knows but I wouldn’t call someone a misogynist for saying it Kind of makes me think you dislike men
0,hekp them you help knowone is all you do is criticise
0,Who’s this for 
0,I left my ex when the police told both me and my mother they were seriously concerned for my safety Not sure the police had that much effect on me but my usually strong mother crying down the phone line certainly did
0,Sorry  you were my favourite politician but now you have been edged into second place
0,Get well soon Steve
0,“Not worth the money” is something people with money say desperate people do desperate things let’s exercise compassion for those who feel obligated to work due to fear of financial melt down Lesser of two evils I am not making any judgement
0,Any number of the journos should raise this every day at the press conference Has it ever been mentioned even once
0,I find any man who would pay money to rape women utterly beneath contempt Calling it sex work is to mask the truth about it
0,are asking our gov to follow other countries examples and to provide both options If this wasn’t the case then refuge’s wouldn’t need to exist I lived with my abuser in his family home amp my only option was to flee
0,Can we have some more men’s shelters then
0,Proactive approach with premises with repeat calls visited subtly A good DV policy can be a homicide reduction tool as well as providing other more obvious benefits
0,Just look at Jess Phillips feed Today full of suggestions re what is needed right now Funding for emergency accom Funding for pop up counselling services Thats the main thing right now and other countries have been stepping in to deliver this
0,You won’t get a response from her She’s just making some noise as she hasn’t been in the spotlight for a bit She has no idea for a solution but just wants to keep screeching as always
0,More important things to worry about Remember
0,So Jess what’s the solution
0,What’s your solution Jess Easy to take cheap shots from the sidelines what do you propose gets done
0,Lot of amateurs on here with some great solutions to difficult situations is paid £k to come up with answers but she offers squat apart from the usual political point scoring
0,If the government wants to help they need to remove the perpetrator
0,What is the strategy at any time
0,I know of a few policemen who get called out but then the women back out time and time again
0,Why are you surprised he was investigated for grooming underage children and got off for that Guess his apology came in the form of a bribe to the cops
0,So give us your solution
0,Yeah that’s the idea concentrate on silly name calling and labelling rather than something constructive about domestic abuseas long as you can hang your silly label on somebody you think you have had a productive day achieving nothing
0,Disgrace  just because he has money he thinks Rules don’t apply to him  not fit to play for ENGLAND
0,and what would you do about domestic abuse Be constructive
0,Then when is the time This is a live issue Government is still operating and given there have already been several domestic homicides there needs to be a response on how to protect people right now
0,He should of just quarantined with them Would have cost a fortune lol
0,Spare a thought for Muslim grooming gangs How are they going to be able to proposition young vulnerable white girls during a lockdown
0,RT  agree
0,RT She doesnt fo that thats why she tanked in the leadership election
0,If you have a solution please share
0,Great Let’s see your detailed proposal with specific action points Complaining isn’t a proposal or a strategy
0,Perhaps you could come up with a solution for the Government I doubt it
0,Hi Jess do you know if the people who have been given temporary accommodation in hotels due to homelessness have also been provided with meals It just occurred to me that while they have been given shelter Im not sure if they are also receiving meals
0,A club fine with a donation to charity would be a better outcome
0,Shes actually also organising the egg hunt 
0,There is not strategy The CCGs and councils aren’t talking to each other and doing their own thing There’s no clinical triage in place and senior managers are busy arguing over what to do As an operational manager I have a front row seat
0,She is grand
0,RT I believe he is taking a break from Twitter so wouldn’t have seen it
0,What would you do Out of interest Genuine question not being an asshole
0,What is your solution I’m genuinely interested
0,RT Weird how people like are not calling this out isn’t it I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t if their comments on anti semitism on the left have been entirely in good faith which I’m absolutely sure they have Probably just missed it
0,
0,What would you suggest
0,Yes  weeks
0,in his own lifetime
0,Hahaha
0,My wife was the victim of domestic abuse for years Its not that she didnt WANT to leave him she was TERRIFIED to In the end she had an hour to grab stuff and run to her cousins house Scoring cheap political points on a complicated issue is EXACTLY what I expect from you
0,it wont have been sex workers he was on his karaoke machine he is a dick though
0,So whats your answer to the question Ill wait
0,Problem is they haven’t acted quickly It is week four of lock down and the CCG I work for still hasn’t developed its policies or enacted any frontline actions to address this
0,You cant legislate for horrible nasty bastards who bully and abuse their partners you just cant You can put measures in place to deal with them but by definition youll be dealing with the abuse theyve already managed to carry out Devious bullies will find a way sadly
0,Jos letter is very clear and well balanced  many of her colleagues should read it and thoroughly digest the sentiments before further commenting Seems a very sensible stance she has on an admittedly complex issue 👍👍👍
0,It needs to start in secondary schools teaching what is acceptable amp what is not  Teach them where to go for help amp how to spot the signs  if only someone would listen to my ideas 
0,Sweden is how we help them For many people who are trapped in these relationships work is their only escape You simply cannot understand what they’re going through Our draconian approach traps them even further
0,Appallingoverpaid egoistical selfish and putting others at riskWho the hell do they think they are
0,From experience I have come to believe that some abusersbullies feel so “entitled” to mistreating their preferred “soft targets” that they can only be dissuaded from committing more violence against their victims by the threat of violent consequences for their actions
0,They certainly need somewhere to escape to  but many dont report it  what to do for those people
0,As a police officer I went to more domestics than I can remember a few involving a dead body There is nothing you can do with couples locked behind closed doors You can publish support services and increase refuge provision as well as prosecuting offenders but all that exists
0,Pretty chuffed to be named in that list so thank you
0,What would you do this heinous crime is hidden and covered up by the victim in many cases  so
0,What you suggest
0,Gender difference
0,I mustve missed the part where she offered a solution Its easy to say thats broken or thats crap Come up with something
0,Swap please Pretty please
0,And that’s not a criticism of Jess I can agree with you without piling in negatively
0,
0,The words “genuine” and “seriously” in that tweet are superfluous Your questions are pertinent It’s a horrible thing that needs constructive action
0,Perhaps there needs to be a movement to make these violent thugs so unacceptable to the public that they are shamed into behaving oh and tougher swifter sentences would help
0,Stop asking me ‘what about men’
0,RT Please RT this Julia ❤
0,Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t this highlighted by a journo at the daily briefing

0,Spent too long in opposition theyve almost forgotten what theyre there for
0,Stay Home Protect the NHS Save Lives Which part of this didn’t reach his brain
0,now ie during corona or from now on
0,Why don’t you help then Ffs if you are going to carry on criticising without any ideas then you will continue to be an opposition with no credibility
0,You clearly don’t understand risk Or care that the risk is greater for women More women die Regardless of whether they report it
0,Not the time to snipe
0,You can lead a horse to water
0,Most of them are self isolating or in hiding
0,Lots of people with problems but no solutionsPolice dv policy hasn’t changed It is like people having a pop at Boris and Tory but not supporting any other party either U have to make a choice at some point and guess what Corbin and labour were embarrassing and Jess knows it
0,My social worker son tells me that child protection referrals are down because children are not at school or nursery
0,Empty rooms Jess nothing more nothing lesswhen the paying public come back they move out
0,She wont have a clue Julia genuinely
0,What reason do you think that might be
0,Oxymoron anyone
0,Domestic abuse makes me so angry People say it is a complex issue and I believe it can be complex for the people who suffer from it It is not complex for the abusers Domestic abuse is always wrong fcking stop it 
0,Well we wait for your ideas on how to make this happen Jess  Or is this yet another opportunity for you to look like your doing your job without actually doing your job 
0,Wasnt he a prominent front bench MP and shadow cabinet member for the whole time it was happening
0,Yup and victims repeatedly go back to perpetrators
0,So what would you of done then 
0,Yea you going to solve it Go on then
0,Homelessness is complex issue like you said so trying to make political gain does not help it
0,Sorry not the budget was cut by  thirds but  thirds of refuges had to cut budgets due to cuts I wasnt clear about that before
0,
0,With Jess Phillips it’s a case of somebody must do something
0,You’re GBH of my ear lobes🙉
0,Please RT this Julia ❤
0,Not really a turn of phrase hysterical schoolboy Would probably use something gender specific
0,
0,I think that’s a good idea The problem is people in those situations are scared to speak out or feel they are to blame It’s awful
0,They could start be reintroducing the  thirds of funding for womens refuges theyve cut since  Its only £m which is chicken feed in the scale of the rest of the hand outs
0,RT I read somewhere this UK is a Union of Equals Westminster Shackling outward looking Scotland or NIreland to an increasingly rightwing insular little England is neither realistic or democratic  Scotland Snp Nireland
0,Thank you so much 🙏❤
0, please can you do me a massive favour and retweet this Anything you can do to help would be appreciated This is for a wonderful woman who helps get sick animals animals off the streets and into their forever home fit healthy and happy

0,this got  likes as well I am never leaving my house ever again am I
0,Delete the last nine words and its good
0,Not having a logical solution is absolutely no reason not to use a complex issue like a stick to beat the government with Apparently
0,Great lets hear the plan Jess
0,compassionate leadership
0,Well Jess astounded us with your plan to deal with it then
0,Jess Philips already wished him well in a special tweet All updated information regarding BJ treatment and where he is comes via No not Jess Philips as it should be As thousands have 🦠 expect she is personally allowed to wish others well with out including BJ every time🤷‍♂️
0,Dickhead Hes old enough to know better A huge fine would serve society better than a playing ban With the money going to help people A playing ban might happen but does little to aid society
0,I presume you have a plan to fix it then
0,Genuine question what is the strategy What would work Victims stay with abusive partners because they’re too scared to leavedon’t know how to leavelove their partners amp many other reasons How do you tackle that Seriously these people need help but how do we do help them
0,How can we small people help
0,no  work for a livingthis is occasional
0,If the choice was between a refuge place for an abuse victim or action that prevented the abuse from occurring in the first place and therefore no need for that refuge place which would you prefer to happen
0,we have a PM who bragged about shaking hands with infected patients and then went on to infect his own family and front bench but the footballer is the problem
0,More money than sense All he can think about is his middle wicket And yes ban him and fine him a determinable amount to be donated to the NHS I’m a City fan and join you in my dismay also
0,What a lovely woman she is🌈
0,We need to act on both sides Support for victims of obvious but the hard fact is that lockdown is triggering more cases of abuse We should be active in reducing that as well
0,NZ is Gods country
0,It wouldnt even been on their radar Jess All they are looking at is minimum cost and penny pinching because they completely ignored the threat for months They gambled with our lives and lost
0,The main psychological vulnerability used by the billionaire elite was bitterness They channeled it towards nationalism racism or religion to harvest the masses votes against the left or metropolitan liberal elites You were conned lied to manipulated used as a tool
0,She is a star no doubt about it
0,As you well know it is up to the local council to provide accommodation for those in domestic violence situations James Callaghan’s government didn’t help me in  but the local council did Stop playing petty politics

0,You missed it Ah you needed to be more proactive see 
0,Well done to you 👏👏👏
0,But information about his treatment and which department comes via No not Jess Philips as it should be
0,Ok so we now know what WONT work 
0,But Jack Grealish drink driving is ok
0,Sad to say it but I could see safeguarding issues with that what if a criminal was able to pose as offering a room only to subject the victim to further abuse

0,Maybe he should have spoken up earlier
0,RT ICU is full of people who are kind efficient and best of all calmly reassuring Thanks to all of them for being there when we need them it cant be easy to do
0,So what do you suggest 
0,A couple of weeks ago she proposed that DV victims be provided with hotel rooms as refuge
0,Would have thought that they acted quickly on the homeless because they could be a vector Its not that they suddenly started caring  people on the streets are an infection risk those stuck in a domestic abuse situation arent Your priorities are admirable irrespective
0,Unfortunately people are dying and getting beaten up of course Jess and every Labour MP wished Boris all the best last night but that cant stop the wheels turning completely
0,Sudden change of tune not buying it
0,Please listen to Jess everyone act now
0,It is if you are starving and have kids to feed
0,I too had it as a child I remember in hospital being turned onto my front twice a day whilst the doctor enthusiastically karate chopped my back to make me cough up the gunk on my lungs Sounds like child cruelty now but it worked
0,Haha typical

0,Where is the screaming 
0,I wrote about DV under lockdown yesterday and I’m done being nice about it too The gov don’t care  are they doing anything at all that you can share or are they simply not listening Is it a choice or do they have a ‘reason’ excuse
0,It’s as good a time as any Victims of domestic abuse are stuck at home all day with their abusive partners They need help and protection at the best of times but when they’re stuck at home They need it now more than ever and the government has swept them under the rug
0,He maybe many things but he’s far from rubbish  brilliant footballer 
0,Also it doesnt exist in the Labour Party
0,Agreed Poor strategy  homeless too though being put into hotels where staff have no training or support to deal with issues
0,It’s a pandemic that is being blatantly ignored
0,“Nice” doesn’t work
0,Actually Philips said she’d stab him in the front She clearly meant she’d openly oppose him instead of starting secret rebellions Stop making a scene where there isn’t one
0,The message was still received understood and agreed with
0,Bye
0,What are you proposing 
0,Although there are still a lot of homeless people on the streets in North London Seeing them on my commute is extremely sad
0,Why cant we use those empty hotels Not a long term solution but could be a temporary solution
0,Totally agree however immediate problems organisations who help DA victims are dealing withlack of resources more demand accommodationsocial distancing means changing to single occupancy instead of multiple occupancy etc I’m no supporter but Scottish government granted m

0,Agreed Other than being a pimp what industry would his behaviour survive in Fed up of seeing people behaving like they’re above the law because they’re good at football
0,What precisely
0,I think I THINK thats her point Its kind of her job as a member of the opposition
0,
0,RT No person Not all domestic abuse is aimed at women by men
0,She is awesome
0,So let me get this straight  the government has literally and quite rightly asked that people stay home This inevitably traps DV victims with their abusers Can you think of a time where it would NOT be more relevant to discuss
0,You go Jess
0,She doesnt fo that thats why she tanked in the leadership election
0,Who should presumably also lose their jobs
0,There’s no need to be nice but constructive helps
0,Did I say anything of the sort Er Thats a no then Theres a time and place for everything and having a go at the government at a time like this is not the right time
0,Keep it classy during this pandemic  NOT Take away his kit
0,Use empty hotels France are doing this already
0,Dear Was Nancy Astor a Nazi admiring AntiSemite YN wants to know Thanks in advance
0,She’s calling for a strategy as to how to tackle this issue the govt can work to protect these people
0,do you remember me
0,Im sorry but who do you then expect to take the government to task over this Wilma Flintstone Its literally the oppositions job to scrutinise
0,So everyone who is currently a victim of domestic violence Should they just accept they’re not gonna be helped Just because we have one issue the Coronavirus doesn’t mean all the other issues are going to just go away
0,These are the members of our communities I worry about the most people suffering behind closed doors What can we do
0,
0,Weird how people like are not calling this out isn’t it I can’t think of any reason why they wouldn’t if their comments on anti semitism on the left have been entirely in good faith which I’m absolutely sure they have Probably just missed it
0,It isn’t her job to hold government to account That’s not her job
0,I know right Like everyone is up in arms about the lockdown breach and avoiding the rest of it
0,You wind your neck in he’s right

0,Congratulations
0,He should be fined  weeks wages donated to local charities Then he should be trained and sent to help clean the local Covid wards so he can see exactly why his behaviour was so wrong
0,Some people cannot have a day off from judging no matter what the circumstances 🤷‍♂️
0,The charities are too busy getting innocent men locked up to help abuse victims
0,I agree with most things you tweet but taking away a mans livelihood is a bit drastic His manager has just lost his mum to the virus and Im sure that he wont let this go unpunished
0,She was asked if she would stab him in the back and said no that she’d tackle issues with him head on It’s a fair statement that has been blown out of all proportion
0,I agree that he should be sacked I am sick of people in authority making rules for others which they consider do not apply to them He says he attended the funeral as an ‘observer’ but he must have been a guest of honour and he didn’t stumble across the funeral by mistake

0,Because he IS thick for having a party and sex with people he doesn’t live withand he IS a footballer 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️i see just facts but you’re another one trying to make race the issue when it’s anger due to lack of respect
0,If the Scottish chief medical officer had to resign because she visited her holiday home during lockdown about  miles from her home any high profile individual should be made to do the same Noone should be above the law and they see actively and consciously spreading death
0,Better ppe than a care home well done

0,Are you serious FFS we will never get rid of this virus with so many dumb people about YOU CANNOT MIX WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSEHOLD
0,So presumably you also want Scots CMO to be banned from ever working in medicine as well Is there anything worse than a Labour populist I thought you were party of tolerance and second chances If child molesters are allowed to work again you not think this is extreme 😂
0,No reason to sack He made a mistake He’s learnt his lesson as I’m sure if others have to
0,Should Scotland’s now exCMO be struck from the medical register  Or is it just working class men you want to deny a living 
0,I cant do this alone

0,Can’t believe it but I agree with you  Along with chemical castration
0,Paying for sex is exploitative and sleazy As a City fan for over  years I don’t want playing for my team  City should sack him
0,Unpleasant as this guy sounds unless you hand out these kind of punishments to all workers im not sure City should do anything Its a police issue if they decide no action then it should be left

0,I thought are whole nhs was run by Europeansor at least that was what we were told Obviously not

0,Yes Even when children’s lives have been threatened the Police and Family Courts do NOTHING How about being isolated in a caravan with the abuser That’s the reality for my children Cut off from contacting anyone for help
0,I think he is an idiot Completely wrong and stupid thing to do But why is it always footballers called out Why should he be banned from playing Plenty of MPs across the land have flouted the rules You want them to get sacked too Call them out too Jess

0,Not disagreeing or agreeing but risking their lives or the lives of others is not really worth the money when people are dying from this virus
0,Im not sure that playing football matches in the near future are that high upon his agenda tbh
0,As blunt as it is if he broke his contract of employment then he will be If he’s hasn’t then he won’t Deserves all the criticism he’s getting too
0,Banning him from playing is a bit of an overreaction He’s made a massive tit of himself and his club should have a the right to fine him but he doesn’t deserve to lose his entire career
0,This is what happens when you let celebrities present as sports people We are particularly to blame Remember we use to call them heroes People are like elephants we never forget Re balance needed

0,Would you suggest employment sanctions for others who arent obeying govt rules Or is it footballers who should be treated this way Not condoning the man is an utter arse but is it a slippery slope to call for economic censure
0,So so selfish People are dying
0,Just another thick overpaid footballer I’m afraid 🤨
0,Technically he didnt break any rules But morally he did But banning him from playing Thats way over the bar

0,RT My reaction to the Governments new guidelines from an education standpoint ✔️ Release the plan  science behind the decision ✔️ Guarantee PPE to all in schools ✔️ Explain how you maintain social distancing for  year olds ✔️ We need more clarity from the Government
0,RT Did the PM just say that he hopes children in primaries to go back end of July and have one month of education And if he did does that mean they are expecting schools to be open all of August Our exhausted teacher workforce may struggle with this
0,If you or Boris think I am sending my  Yr old who has chronic asthma back to nursery while this is still out of control you have another think coming
0,RT This section suggest social distancing should be maintained in nurseries🙈Their answer is a cap Have they MET any yr olds
0,Yes it does
0,RT This is significant While Heads should have the final say there is provision in the emergency bill to force them to open However I doubt this is a fight the Government will want to have I’m on the side of the Heads on this one  they know better the risks in their schools
0,will be happy thats  of them

0,RT Primary schools struggle to contain nits let alone Coronavirus I’m deeply skeptical of plans to bring students back safely especially reception and Y However I am willing to be persuaded by the evidence Question is will we see it before the PM’s statement today
0,yep and all because Swinson thought she could be PM or play the Nick Clegg role LDs enabled Johnson and Brexit in their greed for more seats and power
0,Reckless
0,Honestly the whole thing is seriously disturbing Social distance unless you can’t  which obviously you can’t with primary school children  no evidence it’s safe no evidence primary schools are different from any other social or work setting Just suck it up
0,RT This bit is a little alarming What happens if the child falls ill at school
0,RT Right They do NOT recommend face coverings in school
0,RT Concerned by remarks – the public support an extension If we don’t request by June  we likely face a disastrous No Deal Brexit on  Dec Businesses amp people have suffered enough this year Please reconsider

0,Need twice as many classrooms 😐
0,Hi amp I see PampO ferries is in difficulty Given that we need ferry companies for a NoDeal Brexit and the Govt is probably still planning a NoDeal Brexit do you think we need to have a think about this
0,Have you actually read this article If you had youd realise it has nothing to do with this
0,I feel like that will paint this as one of their policies to improve education as for years people have been complained of overcrowded classrooms and overworked teachers this might allow children to actually learn I hope 🤞🏼😅

0,RT C’mon Looking forward to hearing what our plans are
0,RT If a child or staff member in the  child group is sick and tests positive then the whole group goes into isolation This implies that anyone who falls ill in a school has to have a COVID test which feels a stretch given current issues with testing

0,The event industry also needs furloughselfemployed plan extension
0,RT We need urgent clarity on the Furlough scheme I suggest ➡️ Extend scheme until September to avoid a cliff edge ➡️ Keep  payments for tourism and hospitality industry ➡️ Introduce flexibility to allow people to work parttime where possible
0,RT Staff who are shielding should continue to do so But the implications for this very obvious statement is there will be vacancies which mean higher pupil teacher ratios at a time when you’ve want lower ratios What the plan for filling these A role for supply teachers
0,Or do you think it might be the learning to read stage being crucial I’m not a fan of the decision but can see home educating works much better when children can read
0,RT Class sizes in primaries to decrease to max  with teaching assistants taking the other half This doesn’t sound practical to me
0,

0,No And we can teach them better esp with school workplans already in place than a teaching assistant trying to keep  kids away from each other Theyll learn more at home with us Many people will feel the same I think
0,Corbyn was doing it when there was still hope to stop it Which was infuriating He didn’t support one side or the other Now the people not only have voted for brexit but they confirmed it by voting this shit show of a govt in Keir cannot go against that mandate now

0,RT Surely it was obvious that a vague PM speech delivered before publishing the rules was a recipe for disaster and chaos The Government must do better  bad communications and confusion costs lives
0,RT Totally agree but we also need to ensure that class sizes allow for social distancing and are realistic we must put the safety of staff and pupils first

0,Children at the start of EYs will then have missed half their education during perhaps the most important stage of their cognitive development Many cannot adequately learn at home It is debatable but if you really think there is no case at all you dont understand the problem
0,My first thought
0,How are they exhausted
0,My kids will go back to school when Parliament looks like this
0,There are lots of factors examage pupils clearly have an educational need to be considered My point is only that Laylas apparent claim this is exclusively economic is wrong and coming from a former school leader who should know these things it disappointed me
0,RT elsewhere I made an enquiry about something that you had written how do you social distance small children from each other and this was one of the replies I was sent
0,How did you minimise the risk of  year olds not adhering to social distancing Minimising the risk there is simply refusing to send them in
0,elsewhere I made an enquiry about something that you had written how do you social distance small children from each other and this was one of the replies I was sent
0,RT Here is the guidance For schools gtgt Coronavirus COVID implementing protective measures in education and childcare settings 
0,My kids are not going back to school until their mother and I agree it is safe
0,How big are clarion going to have to be to maintain a m distance I can’t be bothered to do the maths but bloody massive is my guess
0,The last school I worked in already had TAs competing for corridor space in which to work There isn’t a magic building expansion tree and this needs pointing out to the public so that they know the risky situation they’re being asked to put their children in
0,RT Gulp Has anyone told
0,RT Where are these teaching assistants coming from please We have  classes and  TA MANY schools have NONE due to slashed budgets year on year
0,RT With the size of classrooms this isn’t possible It’s a joke They are using teachers and support staff as glorified babysitters
0,RT This is a solution in search of a problem Schools cant have every child in perhaps  at a time so children wont attend each day or full days Some siblings will be in school others not This isnt a childcare solution nor is it really going to be good for infants education
0,RT I like how they have dropped  meters and gone with as far as possible for the desks
0,So it back to herd immunity Dominic Cummings dream come true 🤦‍♂️ all the plebs back at work and their kids back at school you couldn’t make this up
0,Youre a big boy Tom Im sure you can read a bit and find out for yourself and draw your own opinion Contrary to popular belief it isnt actually a legal requirement to have a full dossier ready for anybody on the internet who happens to think your opinion sounds silly
0,He ruled out summer working
0,RT Or I misheard which is possible too
0,And hinting that secondaries should I despair
0,Working and in many cases without their Easter break
0,RT That’s right  and have already backed UniversalBasicIncome The are more ambitious than about the need to tackle inequality in the UK
0,Hi Layla I understand the imperative to help parents get back to work or work more effectively at home All the same it does rather smack of young children being used as guinea pigs Were I a parent I wouldnt be at all comfortable with that
0,They know something you don’t on absolutely every subject matter known to man Take that in
0,RT From the guidance They are asking nurseries to open when schools do
0,Lets be honest they could announce anything and it still wouldnt be practical to you 🤦‍♂️
0,Very
0,RT If a staff member or the child lives with someone who is extremely vulnerable then the advice was to only go of strict distancing can be maintained
0,Gulp Has anyone told
0,How did you work that one out Mr Sayers Could you refer me to anything which supports your assertion that little children are harmed and their welfare suffers by being at home It sounds like complete nonsense to me so I would appreciate the evidence
0,I was also thinking the total days missed for a yr old if our children can go back at all this academic year represents a much bigger  of their whole life than a yr old For a Yr that’s a huge amount of their total experience of school each day is relatively more
0,Interesting most of the teachers I know say that to their bossesthe reality is very different
0,What about the teachers All the school staff Do they not matter What about the people in theor households who might be vulnerable Can we stop for  seconds and think
0,All the teachers I know do  hours a week term time They arent afraid of hard work They would rather they and the children they care for werent used as cannon fodder for the virus tho
0,So if I send my child to school and then has to self isolate because another child tests positive I will have to take unpaid leave from work in order to provide care to my child Has anyone actually thought this train wreck through
0,So what is your proposal Leyla Specifically Leaders provide solutions followers provide only problems
0,Yeah your golden boy plant isnt going to save you He hasnt got the numbers The neoliberal establishment saw to that in December Enjoy your hard virus ravaged mad max brexit
0,Asymptomatic kidspeople
0,Why Its the truth
0,back in schools Instead you seem to want to stand outside the tent and piss in Throwing daft rocks like the govt want schools for childcare so people can go back to work Playing to the FPBE gallery but ducking any sort of responsible thought
0,It should have been year  in Primary and Year  and  for Secondary No one else needs to return until September
0,Whats your solution Kids all stay home exacerbating the attainment gap based on how privileged their upbringing is Schools are key for social mobility and caring for children from troubled homes Id have thought the Lib Dems would appreciate that and the need to get kids 
0,Indeed Its not compulsory anyway until age  in the UK so these will be purely down to the parents
0,They are throwing Primary School teachers under the Covid bus just like they did to care homes Its worse than that though as Govt advice is that teachers should not wear PPE
0,You think that infants and toddlers are the ones to whom the most harm is done remaining at home despite being their young age and their wonderful use as a virus spreader The mandatory age to start school is  so these arent even compulsory education years
0,I dont support an extension now is best time to get out
0,Ok
0,I wont
0,Layla I agree with this view as well Youngest are priority both for their education and enabling parents to work Gvt have said no fines for parents who won’t send kids to school at first amp think that should be supported
0,Thanks to the Lib Dems recklessness selfishness and intransigence Boris Johnson was able to call a Brexit election that he won handsomely He can now do as he pleases  even kill thousands Enjoy the house you built
0,Very safety conscious toddlers
0,Err no Many of them have been sending lessons through Zoom to teach the kids like my brother has Otherwise have been setting out lesson plans to send to them There is never much time off for a Teacher they dont just switch off once at home you know
0,Conversely the trouble is that UKGOV has not implemented effective test trace isolate so infection rate is out of control So what is the alternative Wait  months while hiding as a family under a duvet Or act with prudence and attention to minimising risk
0,But they keep teaching until the test result comes back
0,That was my first thought where are these additional classes being taught corridors
0,RT We need healthy and resilient people to power economic growth Im calling on Government to consider wellbeing metrics alongside GDP – and abandon policies which could harm our health
0,Will teaching assistants be paid teachers wages for stepping up Huge expectation of people on k
0,The trouble is employers will expect that if you have the opportunity to have children in childcare that you should take it amp then work fully so it won’t be much of a choice Also if you choose not to send your child into nursery you will still have to pay to keep the place
0,Layla as a parent of two under the age of  both parents working from home full time I can’t tell you how much I don’t mind them going backI’m sure others may feel differently
0,RT exhausted teachers your an idiot 😂 😂
0,En France aussi le gouvernement nous avait laissé entendre quelque choses comme ça et puis non Jai limpression dêtre un poisson hameçonné avec qui on joue afin de lépuiser cest révélateur dun gain de temps
0,The government is following its own agenda rather than the science Please help protect people and save lives in Britain
0,I do
0,Exhausted
0,🤣👌
0,Transmission between pupils at ry age is probably pretty limited so worth concentrating on how to minimise spread between and from staff and parents
0,This is a solution in search of a problem Schools cant have every child in perhaps  at a time so children wont attend each day or full days Some siblings will be in school others not This isnt a childcare solution nor is it really going to be good for infants education
0,There will be no additional classrooms available so surely pupils will be in part time either AMPM which does away with the need for meals or alternate  days days
0,I wouldn’t really take what he says with any meaning He made a mistake of saying coronavrus was in the water today  he meant sewage water left people panicking for a good while
0,Try a constructive observation rather than negative ones is it because they are easier 
0,What is different is in  we didn’t care about the poor this idiot just said that on live tv
0,Why are the teachers exhausted
0,Whhhooopeee So has mine she works in a nursery Teachers get heaps of time off most years so they’ll just have to bite the bullet a bit
0,RT I am not sending my year  child back to school I’m a key worker and haven’t sent him in We need more data before the schools reopen
0,How can you enforce this And who would want to The emotional and psychological impact of enforced separation aka social distance in a classroom of young children horrifies me
0,This is effectively lifting restrictions for teachers They dont have PPE and yearolds cant practise social distancing so thats it We must be sure that any decisions are based on accurate data
0,So what Nurses supermarket workers farmers Teachers One or two But its a shyte statement from an abuser
0,
0,Exactly When will the testing of kids start then Im glad I dont have small kids It must be so infuriating
0,Still not sure whether there will be protection for parents who have no childcare provision who cant work from home Can they be dismissed BoJo totally fluffed that question Are these parents going to get the same rights as key workers If notwhy not
0,Bollocks Get kids heading towards exams back first Youngest primary kids spend most of the day colouring and eating snotmudanything off the floor
0,exhausted teachers your an idiot 😂 😂
0,Go and ask the Greeks what happened to them If a countries GDP collapses by  it becomes difficult to fund core services Predictions are our economy could have collapsed by a similar amount
0,Of course the govt could continue and improve the furlough scheme and at the same time give schools til Sept to plan and prepare Seems more sensible than happily having the R rate go back up over one and give the middle finger to the NHS and the vulnerable
0,Parents have choice to keep their kids at home Same debate raged in Denmark when schools opened Solution not sending your kids to school is a parental choice Same suggestion here
0,Because there is obviously a balance that needs to be struck Staying in permanent lockdown isnt an option as there is no guarantee this is going to end soon or that we will get a vaccine So we need to open up but in stages and with precautions
0,why what have they been doing just now to be exhausted 
0,RT He just has no idea about schools either
0,There is ZERO risk of the NHS collapsing thru lack of funding There is a very real and palpable risk to it collapsing through being overwhelmed If they want schools to re open serve notice now Give the schools til Sept to plan and prepare and make the funds available
0,My wife is a teacher and has been working normal hours including all of yesterday Sunday
0,I guess we will end up voting with our feet
0,He did say that but I think he meant that they could have a month in school up to end of July He sometimes does confuse people
0,He just has no idea about schools either
0,Remove furlough payments and see if they give you the same answer
0,There’s no way my exciteable impulsive energetic ADD son would have been capable of social distancing aged  Can barely manage at 
0,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0,This sounds similar to the reopening of schools in the Netherlands today Half the class attends on alternate days but no social distancing between pupils just with the teacher Regular scheduled hand hygiene routines etc
0,How can travel be safe when a school is surrounded by residential properties  How can those who live by schools be protected to ensure SD is adhered 
0,So tedious
0,I am not sending my year  child back to school I’m a key worker and haven’t sent him in We need more data before the schools reopen
0,How many schools have TAs in every class Wtf
0,This isnt a choice between saving lives and sacrificing them this is a choice about sacrificing one set of lives for another set You just dont see the other set
0,And if you want NHS to collapse because the govt runs out of money because we all stay at home then you clearly dont care about it Or care about poor people who dont have the luxury of having a middle class job that can be done via Zoom or the people dying of other condirions
0,So why not throw it all open Lets start making money
0,This is what the NEU have been saying in their guidance since schools closed for everyone other than key workers Children should remain in consistent small groups
0,is misinformation DO YOUR JOB
0,Absolutely political suicide when the general public have told you guys enough times they want “brexit done” even if they don’t know what brexit or done is
0,Well there you have it I suggest you change your picture unless you are using it ironically
0,The government should rely on a refreshed look at what the science has to say about this today using the knowledge we have gained instead of merely continuing down the path from two months ago
0,Or social distancing
0,Good luck with number two as well Little kids aren’t great with snotty noses
0,Social distancing is a non starter in nurseries It will have to be put aside for young kids
0,Theyre also the ones for whom the most harm is done by keeping them out of education and the ones whose welfare will deteriorate most quickly from being kept at home Despite obvious practical challenges to overcome this is totally the right decision
0,I dont read that that the teaching assistant takes the other  Just that they might help with the first  Good job this party didnt spend  years cutting budgets whcih lead to the cutting of TAs 😬😬😬
0,I feel like youre part way through marking the governments attempts at clear guidance and that the final grade isnt gonna be good
0,With the size of classrooms this isn’t possible It’s a joke They are using teachers and support staff as glorified babysitters
0,Was this not clear to you before Youre not suspicious enough
0,How the devil are teachers supposed to keep polls in small and stable groups What about the loo Lunchtime Playtime Where’s the extra cash in Barley reduced budgets to pay for additional cleaning PPE for staff
0,Not to mention we don’t have enough classrooms
0,Are you mad
0,Where are these teaching assistants coming from please We have  classes and  TA MANY schools have NONE due to slashed budgets year on year
0,What a stupid comment
0,I have  in my history A Level class and can’t go back yet they’re letting classes of  primary school kids go back This government is utterly brain dead
0,Say that to Oxford West and Abingdon
0,Layla this is scary As a primary teacher the government seem clueless Children of this age may not be most affected but parents of hundreds of children gather together twice a day and so many staff are highrisk They really don’t care about school staff and it’s terrifying
0,Hi Layla  would you also be on the side of parents if they chose not to send their children back to school until they felt it was safe
0,And yes I am in favour of getting things moving because staying in lockdown as it is now is killing other sets of people
0,I like how they have dropped  meters and gone with as far as possible for the desks
0,You foolishly thought he has a grip on real life events of family and children
0,the party of Cyril Smith and
0,And the economy decides if the NHS gets paid or not We saw this in places like Greece during their economic crisis doctors and nurses went without pay for months Unless we get things moving there wont be an NHS
0,What are YOUR suggestions
0,Let’s hear your solution then
0,is misinformation DO YOUR JOB
0,We are going to have to separate those who are vulnerable from those who arent Its the only way Whether that is having separate teaching for those who are vulnerable or have vulnerable teachers do lessons to classes remotely
0,The R rate does decide if the NHS is overwhelmed or not It also is what the govt uses to decide whether to make lockdown stricter or not You are basically saying youre ok with increased infection and death to get back to work
0,RT Layla  Chris Whitty just said we arent comms experts so he seems to have confirmed that they did not sign off the stay alert message  Boris told Ed Davey they did this afternoon
0,Pretty obvious these wouldn’t happen tbf

0,Only the ones in the Cabinet I suspect

0,My wife is a primary teacher and has done a full day every day plus kept our two kids going  whilst Im out at work every day
0,The R rate doesnt pay peoples bills We are going to have to accept a level of risk there are no safe options anymore

0,If they’ve met johnson then well you know where I’m going with this
0,RT More for early years setting comingphew I thought I’d missed something Clearly they know something I don’t about controlling the propensity for children to a listen to institution b not to touch others 🤔
0,So does this mean although me and my wife are both key workers but managing to work it out so that we do not need to send our son to nursery and increase the risk he should be going to nursery We going to be expected to pay for service we do not need to use or lose his space
0,Is that for teachers or kids Because the next sentence seems to contradict the first 🤷🏻‍♂️

0,Head teachers are at work either running remote schooling or in many cases in school for the kids of essential workers
0,It’s potentially more traumatic too
0,All of those swing seats though Layla😉 If Labour were smart theyd have spotted that there is a new Conservative seat cross tab in the Opinium stats which that shows those new seats are unlikely to think that way At least theyre consistent in the dubious grasp of polling
0,Despite having many children I dont believe Mr Johnson has met any  year olds
0,Boris has had plenty of children over the years but it’s pretty clear he’s never had to look after any of them

0,But worse for the schools to open and cause the R rate to go up over  again
0,Thought it was beginning of June last night
0,Somewhat overhopeful to expect Gav Williamson to know the answerto anythingeverat all
0,No the PM did say that I was a bit taken aback by the comment too
0,I think he misspoke
0,We thought he said that But then it would be straight into the long autumn term in September which would be a lot for pupils let alone staff
0,Is that the sketch of the roadmap
0,I think he meant back in early June and by end of June have a whole month of education Ie end in July Obviously nonsense still
0,No he means go back in June for a month before the end of term Or at least thats what the roadmap says
0,Hes like Trump he just spouts dangerous nonsense He told the country that Covid could enter our water supply thats quite a statement
0,Layla this is Boris Johnson He probably doesnt know when state school holidays are Hes like the old countess in Downton Abbey who didnt know what a weekend was
0,Except they havent because schools have remained open for children of key workers
0,Could be but I dont think hes on top of the details if Im honest so who knows if this is true
0,Think we can safely assume he said the wrong month Otherwise thats a  hour turnaround from his statement in the House
0,Exhausted teachers By the time they go back they would have had  months off
0,I teach Reception amp Yr  They need to be able to see our faces to learn eg looking at our mouths to see how to articulate sounds in Phonics They need to play and work in groups because PSE is an important part of the curriculum We cant distance and do up coats And more
0,All teachers have been working throughout the lockdown Head teachers however have had a significantly smaller work load as they are not having to deal with badly behaved pupils which they often spend a lot of time doing
0,If the schools arent open but parents are now expected to work what are they supposed to do
0,The schools are going to need to get their act together on this It is better the schools open than the kids being looked after by grandparents the most at risk group

0,They are and have been at work since the beginning of lockdown
0,How can schools increase distance between pupils when they only have so many rooms and so much space It’s quite clearly a flawed idea
0,Indeed
0,is misinforming The British people DO YOUR JOB

0,Were in the position because Corbyn was AWOL during the referendum wouldnt compromise for a VONC last year and then gave the Tories an  seat majority Would have been futile and crazy for Starmer to attempt to stymie Brexit at this stage
0,You should be more concerned by the government’s stance than an opposition leader with  fewer seats
0,But the current Tories are utterly united on Brexit There is no way they will back down over the extension due to pressure from KS He will have more impact on the next election by showing everyone how badly they messed up taking away their excuses than by nagging them now

0,Corbyn is a brexiter
0,Social workers are already urging vulnerable children to go to school but it is segregation if their friends aren’t going to school
0,Almost every headline about Corbyns Brexit response was extremely misleading but FBPE trashed the party that could have prevented Brexit because they were really only ever interested in stopping social democracy not stopping Brexit

0,Are you saying no one at all would support an extension You might not like it but you’d have to really be off your rocker to claim no one would support that route or that it shouldnt be a consideration especially given the position we currently find ourselves in
0,Guarantee you wouldnt have written that if Corbyn was Labour leader and this story was written exactly the same but about him Funny how FBPE suddenly support fence sitting non opposition on Brexit Starmer knows opposing Tory hard Brexit loses him votes He wont oppose it
0,Depending on the situation people might be in breach of duty as a parent to be sending children to school at such a time No child feels safe and secure going to school if they know that they may bring back a virus which will harm the people around them and possibly even kill
0,Yes what we really need to see if the Covidsecure guidance for workplaces These  pages dont add a lot to what has already been said

0,And what about changing masks No mask will last the length of a school day
0,Please read what he actually said rather than the headline designed to illicit a response

0,Youre in politics come up with some answers rather than the easy task of picking apart every government statement
0,No point opposing it Its culture was bullshit and the left can never win that Just accept it let the economy crash and then hope the scales finally fall from peoples eyes
0,I know dozens of vulnerable children who I would advise go absolutely nowhere near a school including my own child Please lets ensure we understand the individual need Some vulnerable children will stand no chance if they catch the virus so should isolate at all costs

0,He knows he has no control over an extension it won’t happen so why support it anyway he wants to move away form his position on Brexit it is as it is
0,That is really the bottom line As a QC he is closing off exits and excuses before skewering the government when they fail to deliver
0,Starmer turning out to be as useless as Corbyn Are there no Labour MPs with the backbone and intelligence to listen to what the British electorate is now saying Supporting a fraudulent referendum is NOT democracy

0,Who says the public support an extension Is this the same people you were telling us prior to Dec th that wanted to Stop Brexit
0,Which people would know if they read beyond the headline
0,This model in Science shows asymptomatic carriers contribute next to nothing to Covid transmission Therefore the risk from sending kids back to school is much smaller than opening up workplaces and shops
0,Yes its time to ignore the xenophopes sic and utltra nationalists We need an extension and we need it by June
0,Is this for real Is he saying that he thinks young people training to be nurses doctors vets builders scientists farmers teachers musicians pilots caterers etc etc etc are not worth paying a decent salary
0,RT As a teacher who has worked in Reception and Y I know that it is impossible for young children even class to social distance from each other and school staff
0,Considering how hard he pushed for it under Corbyn its curious why this concern has now evaporated since he is in the job

0,Quite otherwise we will need to order more body bags A quite staggering state of affairs for a G nation
0,Only  children under  out of  million in the UK have died an almost zero risk Meanwhile childrens education suffers and vulnerable children are put at risk of abuse and worse Is that a strong enough argument for reopening schools

0,This choice then ultimately comes down to money and also how able you are to educate your children There are no safe or risk free choices anymore For people who need  incomes to live then there has to be a childcare facility and that will either be the school or other family
0,I didnt mean older as in  I meant older as in older than schoolage kids say  below age  the risk of getting ill from COVID is extremely low
0,Same

0,RT As a reception teacher Id really love to know the answer to this Answers on a postcard Id also like to know how BorisJohnson plans to meet the FiveTests
0,There probably arent many  parents with young kids
0,Parents of our age are certainly old enough to get ill and die of this And a fair proportion will have underlying medical conditions or medications that mean theyre at even higher risk
0,mmm If the older people are the parents that becomes difficult
0,What point are you trying to make exactly  only Dominic Cummings can ask for an extension and he won’t so what does it matter what Kier Starmer says
0,Even if not coughing theyll still be breathing — and wiping their noses on their hands and touching all kinds of things Because theyre small kids and small kids are basically sticky snotty monsters whove not learned hygiene yet I am not a parent I might be prejudiced

0,Apart from Miranda any nonCHUK ones Anna didnt join Lib dems did she she ran under IG at last election How about

0,Im with Shauna on this tbh
0,sCeptical
0,Theyre not normally symptomatic — they are unlikely to get ill and virtually certainly will survive if they do But if they can bring the virus home with them and pass it on to older people in the house thats still a problem
0,Seriously what is the logic of sending ReceptionYr back to school first Ever tried getting an alert class of  yr olds to stand in a straight line with  M between each of them Let’s not even think about toileting

0,if Keir cant even object to a No Deal Brexit Labour might as well shut down today they ill never be electable
0,There hasnt been a proper study yet to conclude one way or the other But one aspect that has come out of the data is children are not generally affected by the virus
0,RT What we really needed were tighter instructions and assurances about protecting those who are physically and economically vulnerable following the lockdown extension
0,Why should he back it He is not the PM Let the do his thing and let the country go to shit
0,this isnt me nitpicking Im not following the literature on this sort of thing so Im open to all possibilities
0,Is that a theres not been a good study yet lack of evidence or has it been properly demonstrated that asymptomatic kids arent contagious or arent contagious by airborne droplets or whatever
0,RT Agree I like and he has struck a very good tone on coronavirus and found a balance between holding govt to account in not being partisan but he must be highlighting that gov do not have a year they have less than  months in which to extend
0,Our schools corridors aren’t even  metres wide  kids in a classroom with barely room between desks and walls Social distancing is impossible Plus 
0,Theres nothing Labour can do about extending the transition except get slammed by the press as obstructionist remoaners That ship really has sailed The Tories will just have to own what they do now
0,BllX to BREXIT
0,
0,There is no evidence whatsoever that what amounts to a few months missing school in one year is going to detriment their social development
0,Nits
0,Where did you deduce the public support an extension  Why is a no deal Brexit always preceded by a negative adjective It is and always has been our bargaining chip EU would dread a no deal Especially now
0,It’s not bad faith schools are important for social development for kids it’s a controlled environment too keeping them mostly at home with many unable to access gardens or see friends causes huge damage
0,You can’t see something that doesn’t exist
0,I didnt say isolation but if all you have is bad faith arguments
0,I think this is a bizarre stance to take To me its common sense that you cant negotiate a good deal effectivelyefficiently when there is a global pandemic Keir could even take the line of the government that weve already left  but need this vital time used up by covid
0,Yeh isolation is so good for kids well being a development
0,We should focus less on getting kids back to school and more on efforts to have government financially and legally support families that have to take time from work to look after those kids that need to stay home
0,Well said Layla Is Labour going to fail yet again  Looks like Starmer more interested in pleasing Brexiteers
0,Very disappointed to hear that from
0,There is very little evidence that kids do pass on the virus when asymptomatic The biggest spread is when someone is coughing and sneezing
0,There is next to no reason now for kids you go back to school until September now outside of a select few for specific reasons Schools could be operated on much fewer student numbers but some families would need to keep kids home
0,shambles
0,Remind us what Jeremy Corbyns stance is on Brexit and the science of covid transmission The guy was and is a loon
0,He can’t stop it and your theory last time really worked didn’t it
0,Cleansing routines are only useful if you also have effective and comprehensive testing If the kids are infected and asymptomatic as almost all infected children are then this needs to be identified before they pass it around
0,Why It makes no sense not to meet both parents
0,They wont but China is showing how they have reopened their schools We have to start putting in place cleansing routines on the way in to school and not rely on social distancing once they are in
0,I hate Brexit I hate the Tories and the Brexiteers but this Tory government will try to ofoad Brexit on the British people you wanted it so you have it I would form no dialogue to help the Tories its their Brexit Would not want to be a politician right now
0,We dont know and have no reason to believe they are any less infectious though so how resilient they are is a moot point
0,Please share any response you get
0,Please check your child Your child if infected will almost certainly be asymptomatic Tests are not available Please take whatever measures you think are appropriate Good luck
0,I shudder to think how they will make yearolds obey social distancing rules how they will explain it to them and what effect that will have on the children in question
0,You have fallen for the trap and provide the narrative to split “us” He didn’t Think about it
0,Sounds like you have little faith in teachers Plus nits are hardly a great comparison We know kids are more resilient to Covid than the rest of population perhaps we need to think of the mental health damage we have done to them instead over the past couple of months
0,No extension at any cost
0,Bobby Moore was only just  when he lifted the World Cup……
0,Which are the best and worst in your experience
0,You need to just Let it go Were out and thats not going to change so there is no reason to delay EU politicians need to focus and get on with tying up the loose ends
0,Theyll send home letters saying that a member of your childs class has Covid so please check your child They wont be able to tell the parents of that child for fear of embarressing them
0,What about the huge gulf between school’s provision since lockdown Some schools not just private are leading their pupils through daily considered schemes of work allowing parents to get on with their jobs as best they can whilst others have had no personal contact at all
0,if you are in Commons and ask a question please compel Johnson or Williamson to explicitly tell the country most pupils will not be back until September
0,Please could you push for detailed advice for drop offspick ups at primary school At our school there will be  parentsguardians in the small playground twice a day
0,I hope he will push for an extension but not the right time just now  we have  months in hand  voters still loving Johnson  Govt has full agenda of other stuff  maybe better to push for what the Govt plan is and then push for extension with facts underlying case
0,We could arrange an exchange in the middle of the Atlantic and just run away and leave them there

0,Those have a brick wall behind them I gonna assume youre talking about the EU somehow which is a Union that we were part of and therefore legitimate Though I dont see how they pervert our democratic system Basically youre pissed off that others have a say
0,To me if you do those as a female ill marry no doubt
0,This is why we need unity government and can only get this if will persuade  Tory’s there must be some who will act in national interest and have a VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE Then extend transition reorganise parliament and introduce proportional representation
0,Like I say all sounds so simple when you dont question the details Brexit means brexit Virus means virus Etc

0,Layla revealing her poker cards
0,Like when we were teenagers
0,By crunchpoint at EOYwell already be deep in recession The argument will be that business need certainty not further upset Both sides will agree on this as is the argument for an extension but with no presure from the opposition to change tack theyll press on regardless
0,Theres been no vote for an extension you need to operate in the real world and fight the torys
0,RT It is such a shame you lot in the LimpDems did not support Jeremy when you had the chance all of this mess since could have been avoided and mitigated 
0,Errr because were doing so well
0,What path will that be then Who will we be trading with It all sounds so simple when theres no detail
0,This is why every answer Keir gave was “they have said they will do it”
0,No we lost it’s over leave it alone The public have spoke we leave December I voted remain didn’t want to leave but we lost twice People have to move on from this
0,Covid is evident now That’s not an excuse if Covid was going to make things difficult for them they should have asked for an extension It might have been different if Covid struck in September this year after the chance to ask for an extension had gone
0,It is such a shame you lot in the LimpDems did not support Jeremy when you had the chance all of this mess since could have been avoided and mitigated 
0,He has lost his common sense Vote loser

0,Youll be fine as long as you pretend theyre someone elses parents
0,They made it very clear that they abosultely will not agree to a and will plough on with b However we disagree over who will be to blame Or at least who they will spin will be to blame Theyll argue the failure to negotiate a deal is down to the covid crisis not them
0,RT Layla stating policy on LBC is not as helpful as stating it clearly in Parliament This is being spun for no good reason
0,RT I have no doubt he will do in the House You should imho be supporting him and discussing best way to avoid a no deal Brexit
0,Some of the public support an extension of the transition period just as some support an extension of the lockdown period You can’t claim “the public” as a whole for anything
0,That ship has sailed accept the fact you lost an election and with a Govt majority of  they can do what they want No point moaning now after your disastrous general election strategy
0,There is no deal that would be acceptable to the Tory leadershipERGright of the Tory party and with such a large majority and all the sensible voices gone from the Tory back benches theres nothing we or anyone else can do to avoid a no deal Brexit
0,The time for Starmer to make a substantive comment on the EU negotiations is when there is a progress report being made in June Now it’s hold Boris to account time on Coronavirus No need to muddy the waters Tories would love that
0,wow i hope we keep on losing like that all the time then
0,Good its about time country had period of stability
0,The opposite to the right curious what’s a bot🤔
0,The Tories lost the election too But as the election wasnt democratic they came out of it with an seat majority nonetheless
0,you will have clarity in  weeks
0,I can feel another letter coming on
0,BorisJohnson amp his team have talked about COVID using the word war Remember Careless talk costs lives Last night amp todays confusion is almost straight from Oscarwilde  To confuse once may be regarded as a misfortune to confuse twice looks like carelessness
0,TBH past caring about referendum I just dont want more chaos going into 
0,The headline is deliberately misleading it’s not what he said You either didn’t read the article or you have misunderstood what he did say Don’t repeat Jo Swinson’s mistakes and attack Starmer when you should be lending him support You risk letting the Tories off the hook
0,Either way they wont be able to blame us for undermining them Either way they will be failing to achieve goals they set themselves and with nobody else to blame
0,To go a little further I would argue that a vague PM is a recipe for disaster and chaos but thats what we have
0,Layla stating policy on LBC is not as helpful as stating it clearly in Parliament This is being spun for no good reason
0,No they don’t
0,the uk is clear no ecj supremacy no level playing field our own eez these are our terms for doing a deal  red lines that will not be crossed
0,Assuming we both agree they wont get a deal They will either a be forced to ask for an extension of their own volition which is embarrassing and good for the country Or b they wont ask will fail to obtain a deal in which case they fail on their own terms
0,I have no doubt he will do in the House You should imho be supporting him and discussing best way to avoid a no deal Brexit
0,Okay so maybe my question was as vague as Boris last night so I understand your confusion Important to tell me you were male Thats interesting And a fulltime worker and Tax payer Also illuminating Lets move on to Stage  What is a Leftie

0,yeah the losers who keep on losing always say that to me
0,It may have escaped your attention but is sadly not the PM lost the recent election by a huge margin As such his backingnonbacking is largely irrelevant
0,Back down from closer alignment
0,People don’t get the strategy in picking battles Starmer can’t affect the transition deadline one bit so why pick an unwinnable and unpopular fight over it All it would do is mobilise the UKFlagbotsquad
0,Parliamentary is correct in that phrase
0,Starmer evidently believes in never interrupting an opponent when he is making a mistake Good You are making an error in thinking this is the Brexit endgame Its not
0,does the public wants an extension mean the same as the public wants a labour government and the public want to remain in the EUand the public want a nd vote is it one of those things only saying
0,Exactly The EU want us to extend but we shouldn’t if a deal cannot be struck we have to leave on WTO terms At least that way we will have the flexibility to forge our own path
0,the eu has to back down or its no deal no deal doesnt exist as such
0,The only way to get the thick brexiters to realise its a stupid idea is to crash out Tighten your seat belts
0,They won’t ‘own it’ they’ll just blame Covid
0,and then for us to be able to sell it to them at agreed rates  i think you would find they would say NON 
0,the eu has done it to themselves they are demanding ecj supremacy rights to our territory and level playing feild demands what would the french think if we had rights to take their grapes the courts back up our rights up to take it as and when we see fit
0,I’m a member please play the political game better We’ve been rubbish at it and statements like this is more rubbish It’s clear what he’s doing  applying heat to the Tories Let him get on with it
0,which is why we dont want an extension let EU sort it out
0,You do realise the public gave the Tories a huge majority The vast majority aren’t interested in the Lib Dem way
0,Starmer obviously wants to keep some voters on board
0,RT I keep saying that about Starmer to Starmerites and they get as angry as Corbynites It is not like they did not see Starmers behaviour on Brexit for  years
0,Remainer We’ve already left mate
0,Remember if the Tories crash out without a deal next year it’s game over for them
0,Because there is a plague sweeping this land You just dodnt get it do you Yet again the lib dems not getting on and thinking about the people just yourselves
0,Right Feels like it 😆
0,Angry wasps everywhere 🥺 But in the end it was just down to Starmer  v  Corbyn 😒
0,Get it done then But deadline fast approaching
0,Erm human male and full time worker and tax payer
0,the words youre looking for are parliamentary democracy youre welcome
0,I also dont think that those of us on the proEU side should be expecting an extension or even bothering to push for one for the reasons you gave I was simply saying that that law has nothing to do with why The law itself is pure PR nothing more
0,“The public support an extension”  really Where’s the evidence of that
0,The public support an extension Is this just your opinion or have we had a vote on it
0,we have done this but it wont matter if the eu insist on ecj supremacy equal fishing rights by denying us the agreed eez and the level playing field demands they are in for a bit of a shock
0,The public do not support an extension Where did you get that ridiculous notion from And before you answer just reflect on how many seats you won at the recent GE with your EU policy and how many did the win with the policy now being pursued by the Govt
0,I know you want to be one of the good guys but theres a Mitchell and Webb sketch you maybe interested in

0,I reiterate probably uselessly knowing how deaf to reason amp sensible advice BorisJohnson is that for primaryschool Children to return to school as early as st June would be reckless amp insane

0,So true And why is there never any mention of nursery reopenings It would be helpful to know where they fit into the plan
0,RT The government needs to issue guidance to all employers particularly schools negotiated with unions so that employers can then plan how to make this a reality It should not be your job to decide what’s safe Leaders should only have to assess how that might be possible

0,Yes and the R rate in Germany has now moved above  News today Italy and spain not returning
0,
0,Also whose science Scientists in many other countries have decided not to send them back as its not safe Still as always we believe ours know better Thats working well so far for us
0,Go back Most schools are open now Yes I have some idea as I work in a school that has remained open since the outbreak started  through holidays as well The children cant distance there is limited PPE and staff get ill Time that by  fold and there is your answer
0,Maybe of being effected themselves But no one knows the role they play in spreading it yet and they cant social distance Watch the R number rise In Germany now over  again
0,There wont be practice days secondary schools are shut What are you expecting them to learn about transition back in their primary setting with reception and year  kids
0,At least when did the sketch he was funny Johnson lacked the delivery and most definitely the style
0,Layla I work for an org that advises physiotherapists Despite being in the exempt category they couldnt meet the guidance for social distancing but they are desperate to get back to treating their patients This vague advice is going to be a nightmare for so many ppl

0,RT Year  should be back they have a really important year next year Not helpful saying they might get time with their teachers before July
0,And genuinely indepdent scientific advice Not advice from scientists whose jobs rely on toeing the party line And yes before anyone jumps on me thats the right spelling of toeing
0,It signifies everything that is wrong with today’s world when junk food drivethro’s are deemed more important than our nations garden centres which are perfect places to sell their goods outdoors at a safe distance

0,Infant schools wont have plenty of empty rooms In a two form entry they will have  empty rooms You confident  yr olds will social distance
0,But we have had no guidance or legislation on the sustainable approach This was the point I was making As a teacher we always ensure to cater for every child and create a safe and engaging environment but with this new pandemic we need some professional guidance Gov are quiet
0,What if you are in an Infants School where its just Rec Y and Y
0,except I do have a point cuz Im talking about selfID spaces not unisex spaces these are different things also I have a uterus just to be clear lmao

0,Except thats not what SelfID allows What upset that you suddenly dont have evidence to debunk my point lmao
0,Are they going to suggest cages or something
0,SelfID still has separate spaces for women and men Unisex does not Your study is on unisex spaces The vast number of countries and states that allow SelfID for bathroom use do not have unisex spaces

0,That was my first thought
0,Exactly There are so many things wrong with what the president said today The biggest concern is the opening of primary schools there is no way that schools should open in June  months of no in class study wont lead to the children being dumb Especially with the online work
0,The science seems to be increasingly pointing towards them having as high viral loads as adults though their immature immune systems seem less likely to flare up catastrophically

0,TWO have that I know 😉
0,It really isnt complicated We dont know when but at some point we will move to step  Step  means schools start a phased return starting with R  amp  The earliest is June but whenever it is how will schools implement social distancing especially for R amp 
0,Hahaha I saw what you did there And you call them dumb
0,Of all the key workers I know NONE have sent their kids in
0,Go back and listen again He specifically said a phased return starting with R  and  So once sgain The timing of that is not the issue Whenever it is by step  social distancing will still be required so again How will schools do social distancing
0,Take advice from your union but dont put your personal safety or health at risk COVID

0,No ones saying he said theyre going back now He DID say that step  would see the start of a phased return starting with R  amp  When step  isnt the question The question is how will schools ensure social distancing of R amp  Ill give you a clue The answer is they cant

0,The problem with the science
0,This will be ironed out during prep for this moment If and when it happens But likely that it won’t be whole year groups and that not all parents will send kids in
0,It’s a work in progress and all we need to do is support the govt and be positive not just saying it but meaning it Doing less politicising because this is serious and nothing to do with politics
0,But if he says go back and you dont are you entitled to any support Not very clear
0,RT They havent said you have to social distance school kids They have said that from June they will look at reopening schools for the younger ones but only if the conditions are met This really isnt hard and you are deliberately confusing it for political gain Irresponsible

0,Time to call Police in investigate charges of involvol manslaughter We cant allow a Hillsborough death rate every few hours Public inquiry later Arrest amp removal now
0,Doesn’t mean we should be unreasonable and cowards
0,Mindset aside What I was previously stating was that better communication and a forewarning with local authority and a plan would create a smoother transition in this ‘new way’ of working He could have done that I’m positive even with your suggestion of resigning
0,Maybe you can do better then let me know and I can vote for you when the time comes Saying that with every money and network available in the whole world NONE could warn the world of the devastating effect of Covid Tells you that we all are just flesh and blood money aside
0,My speciality isn’t mental health Many things do turn political but I guess that’s what happens when many different people communicate on social media Not always a bad thing Let’s put it this way We clearly have different views but can share dialogue without confrontation
0,Still no word from Jason J Hunter about the fake anonymous account   that continues to stalk and abuse his exgirlfriend Lyndsey Knox The police need to investigate this
0,Going back to work at this time is like climbing a mountain with no preparation You can either tell yourself you can do it or give up without trying The choice is there  Nothing to do with Prime Minister
0,Thankful that I’m atheist He is a PM that has taken on the role to lead the nation even in terms of crisis and success That’s his role He has the money research and support network to do the very best for the country and yet he has made mistake after mistake

0,Transition Days  Last week of the year Push the date back as far as possible Still get those days in that way too
0,I heard an academic who had researched the effects of various control measures say on the radio last week that closing schools was one of the measures shown to be effective in reducing transmissionSadly I can remember who she was

0,Best for staff to stay at home indefinitely if that’s the case Working or not
0,Fair enough 😀 think about it yourself what can you do to help your class Remember he is the PM and not a God so I can assure you that he is as confused as you but putting on a brave face  We all need to help if we are going to beat this Covid
0,My former Boss used to walk of topic when he has nothing to say by’we’re working on it’ I have a question for BoJo’s team behind this glorious speechyou told him that there are so many IFs that if he dare give certain long term answers he’ll land on wrong in didn’t you 🤣
0, Mental health is absolutely important and life will continue but the unions  stage approach seems to have been disregarded Many schools have been open and teachers being placed on rotas Furthermore many of us do weekly planning and videos for the children Yes we are paid
0,I’m not asking the PM to do everything for us however I and many others feel he hasn’t even provided us with a coherent approach Many ministers contradicting each other in the past weeks in terms of policy and guidance 
0,I think it was designed to muddy the waters
0,For a man who puts such store by oratory he isn’t a good communicator
0,How ever did they manage setting work and teaching a class before Coronavirus Not all teachers will have vulnerable people or even kids themselves There are also all the secondary school teachers not doing anything and supply teachers It’s doable if there is the will
0,He did say more detail tomorrow
0,Sorry but I feel that the PM can’t do everything for us He is a human being too  We are human beings and can think for ourselves PM will give us guidelines and it’s left for us and your bosses to ask for assistance in order to help you do your job

0,I am appalled by address It has caused even more confusion and anxiety for schools than it has reassurances
0,You should ask for clarity     like last time
0,
0,Most infant junior schools are two form entry so obviously there are plenty of empty class rooms to spread the children about ensuring teachers assistants can be kept apart Startend times can be staggered for each different years to minimise crowding at the school gate
0,His speech raises sooooo many questions for all of us Is that really all he has after all this time to prepare Im horrified
0,We have been seeing incredibly alarming symptoms in children who have suffered the virus  some who were asymptomatic this cannot be ignored
0,Please ask if British scientists are saying children cant spread this virus If they can it is premature to tell them to return to school German research showed kids have the same viral load as adults
0,Its ridiculous If he thinks im going to send our Y back to school without testing and tracing then Johnson is thicker than I thought he was and I already thought he was pretty blody thick Can the Tories at least put an adult in charge  JohnsonMustGo COVIDIOT
0,He said say more detail tomorrow to be fair
0,I’ve just made my views known on this
0,What does “limit contact with other people mean” Prime example people are already saying can they have garden parties
0,I thought you all wanted him to make a detailed statement to parliament You cannot have both
0,Agreed
0,That is a very diplomatic and politically correct response
0,This is so so true
0,It was also the only way to beat covid throughout the whole of February and March and yet they just went on doing nothing until they were in immediate danger of overwhelming the NHS
0,Johnny Nash covers Johnsons statement pretty well There are more questions than answers Pictures in my mind that will not show There are more questions than answers And the more I find out the less I know Yeah the more I find out the less I know
0,Yes and  My daughter in year  in a Richmond secondary school and she is deemed as less of a priority than year  children Private school pupils have zoom lessons all day Not so in the state sector Please raise with
0,Whos going to look after the children when their parents are called into work Boris Conservatives Briefing Coronavirus Work Labour Johnson
0,Well done Layla a politician actually listening to and seeking the views of the teaching profession A shame more dont do the same
0,And what about Special Schools Social distancing is especially difficult Some of the kids have fragile health But keeping them closed is very difficult when many families have lost the out of school support they rely on
0,It was a speech of nothing Im no clearer as to what I should do
0,Who knows what the situation will be when they reopen in  weeks or  weeks or when ever they reopen All the PM said today was that the earliest they could open is June based on the science then He said nothing about social distancing in schools This is deliberate hysteria
0,STAY HOME STAY SAFE DO NOT FOLLOW HIS DEADLY ADVICE Johnson has just killed thousands more people Wales Scotland and Northern Island have already rejected it
0,Be a teacher and show them it’s your duty
0,Year  will deal with it Children are resilient What they willnti deal with is a death of a class mate a teacher a family member
0,The same scenarios as every country who need to get children back into education HTs should be looking at how Denmark The Netherlands are approaching the same problem As a teacher Im only going back as long I get PPE and the kids are protected
0,You don’t you can’t simple as that
0,And Id suggest for all primary aged children
0,I just went ahead and assumed that since we were being treated to covid handling via leaks then all hope of a lengthy scientific document covering the details for each sector or context was already lost Felt like a total mug for ever expecting otherwise
0,Bad enough trying to remind  teenagers at a secondary school
0,Spot on If you are self employed will HMRC now be making judgements about whether you can go to work and therefore not pay you as part of the support scheme Same question on furlough scheme Will it stop now if you are employed in a factory or construction
0,You realise there are adults in school as well and even if young children are not at major risk themselves are you saying they dont carry the virus They live in families some of whom are extremely vulnerable If schools are to reopen theyll need to implement social distancing
0,Yes last Wednesday in school a Reception child picked her nose then walked straight over to me and touched my stomach BorisJohnson
0,What a load of utter nonsense Johnson has just said Apart from the schools expecting those who cant work at home should travel to the workplace but not use public transport What does Be Alert mean
0,No apparently its spelt
0,Science says to carry on distancing Anyone with sense  and the resources  will be home tutoring The rest who do not matter to the Tories will go to the wall
0,Youre looking in a mirror when you say that right
0,As a teacher who has worked in Reception and Y I know that it is impossible for young children even class to social distance from each other and school staff
0,What do the teachers and other staff need given they would have to protect themselves against asymptomatic young children with no respect for hygiene or distancing How do they then protect their own families who will then go shopping and mic with others
0,Would you really expect anything else 
0,RT So as a citizen of this country who doesnt go to work on public transport but does go to work in peoples houses where the virus may linger or where people with the virus may be housed should I go to work or not Anyone got an answer
0,Maybe replay it Layla No return to school yet

0,He said And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport so presumably details on logistics will be given to schools Maybe if you ask you can get a copy too
0,I have a child in year  and  children who have been in our  one of whom had SEND Practice days and lessons can be done in August and September when we are even further from the peak Kids wont melt down

0,You need to write them about this Layla
0,You cant it is just idiotic
0,It’s a plan he’s not opening schools yet so wait until closer to time It’s really not that tough to digest You asked for roadmap and he’s literally just given you one
0,So are the media getting the details before the MPs in Parliament are BorisSpeech
0,Yeah they DO need to get in asap They need closure They need to finish their primary education socially and emotionally They need a chance to experience secondary schools They need transition They need to go back ASAP
0,What would you do then Layla Come on enlighten us with your knowledge
0,No they dont Year  maybe but is there any point in exposing year  to Covid Secondary schools are quite capable of dealing with year  induction they have been doing it for years
0,Year  should be back they have a really important year next year Not helpful saying they might get time with their teachers before July
0,I know my Y children would really struggle with this too Adults find it tough enough
0,Oh my god do you have any idea what Y is for Its more than SATs Its transition closure esp for SEND kids the practice lessons and days at their new senior schools are vital Or we will be looking at a cohort of refusers come October when all the kids have melted down
0,RT Dont lose your temper now DomesticViolence DomesticViolenceOnMen libdems
0,Aren’t they at school already if they’re the kids of key workers
0,I would say hes clearly never met a  year old but  actually thats entirely possible So Ill be needed back in my schools office primary admin asst but my childrens own school have already told me Im not a keyworker so they yrs  and  cant be cared for
0,What potential threat does a trans woman using the restroom pose Remember the VAST majority of trans women just want to pee Trans women have been using the women’s restroom for decades and yet there isn’t a vast history of abuse by trans women
0,They havent said you have to social distance school kids They have said that from June they will look at reopening schools for the younger ones but only if the conditions are met This really isnt hard and you are deliberately confusing it for political gain Irresponsible
0,RT You can’t The science must be clear than children are not spreaders before this happens 
0,Baffling  No way its possible What if a  year old child falls over Even getting children to wash their hands at that age requires close supervisionhelp
0,SATs are gone so no need for year  children to get back They will get tested in their new school
0,So as a citizen of this country who doesnt go to work on public transport but does go to work in peoples houses where the virus may linger or where people with the virus may be housed should I go to work or not Anyone got an answer
0,I loathe Boris but he is quite right Y need to be back in as soon as the doors can be opened
0,I struggled social distancing with  children mixed RI teach reception 😦
0,I thought the science was saying that young kids didn’t spread it so makes sense
0,Im sure cycling Kev knows better than worldrenowned epidemiologist Chris Whitty
0,They’re also going to be so excited to see their friends teachers and be back in their provision Clearly the PM didn’t take a lot of notice of the unions guidance
